# Clock In

The project's objective is to create a time clock to control the student's attendance at Senai Roberto Mange School, using the microprocessor Raspberry Pi 4 with a rfID tag. 

For this project we used our knowledge acquired in the Hardware, Operating Systems and Pyhton classes, with the guidance of teacher Celso Ricardo. 

Project developed by the students: Luís Felipe, Luís Beck, Matheus Aprigio and Raphael Torres.
